The paper provides a brief review of microsimulation and spatial microsimulation, highlighting the paucity in applications aimed at the analysis of educational policy. It then briefly reviews the educational policy framework in Britain and discusses relevant application areas for spatial microsimulation. It also demonstrates how spatial microsimulation modelling can be used to generate educational policy-relevant outputs and to map and analyse social and spatial inequalities in educational attainment. The paper presents three educational policy scenarios and uses a spatial microsimulation model to assess their spatial and social impact in the region of Yorkshire and the Humber, UK. Finally, in the light of the model outputs and policy analysis scenarios, the paper discusses possible future extensions and policy applications. One of the major findings is the division in the participation of young people to higher education changes by where they live.},

We assess the effect of the pandemic on urban economic geography at the intra- and inter-regional geographic scales in the context of four main forces: the social scarring instilled by the pandemic; the lockdown as a forced experiment; the need to secure the urban built environment against future risks; and changes in the urban form and system. At the macrogeographic scale, we argue the pandemic is unlikely to significantly alter the winner-take-all economic geography and spatial inequality of the global city system. At the microgeographic scale, however, we suggest that it may bring about a series of short-term and some longer-running social changes in the structure and morphology of cities, suburbs and metropolitan regions. The durability and extent of these changes will depend on the timeline and length of the pandemic.},

Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass lediglich zu Krisenbeginn der Schock in ländlichen Regionen etwas stärker ausfiel. Im weiteren Verlauf der Krise waren dann vor allem große Agglomerationen deutlicher und auch dauerhafter betroffen. Wir führen diese stärkeren Effekte der Pandemie auf die Arbeitsmärkte in großen Agglomerationen vor allem auf zwei Faktoren zurück. Erstens ergibt sich hier eine relativ hohe Zugangsrate in Arbeitslosigkeit, die in einem positiven Zusammenhang steht mit einem höheren Anteil hochqualifizierter Beschäftigter in Kombination mit überproportional vielen Jobs, die für das Arbeiten von zu Hause geeignet sind. Eine mögliche Erklärung hierfür sind Spillover-Effekte ausgehend von einer geringeren Nachfrage nach Gütern und Dienstleistungen in Großstädten, die sich durch vermehrtes mobiles Arbeiten und aus der zunehmenden Nutzung des Online-Handels ergibt. Zweitens geht eine höhere Vorkrisen-Arbeitslosenquote in großen Agglomerationen mit einer geringeren Abgangsrate aus Arbeitslosigkeit einher. Dies könnte die ungünstigere Qualifikationsstruktur der Arbeitslosigkeit in Großstädten widerspiegeln, die die Wahrscheinlichkeit von Übergängen in Beschäftigung während Krisen verringert.},

In particular, consumer grouping based on sampled data is not assured to link with the other statistics that are vital in estimating sampling biases and missing variables in the sampling survey. To overcome this difﬁculty, we propose a useful combination of spatial interaction modelling and microsimulation approaches for the reliable estimation of retail interactions based on a sample survey of consumer behaviour being linked with other areal statistics. We demonstrate this approach by building an operational retail interaction model to estimate expenditure ﬂows from households to retail stores in a local city in Japan, Kusatsu City.},

There have been a number of recent surveys of “mainstream” spatial microsimulation models and associated methodologies. The contribution of this paper relates mainly in extending these surveys by considering other micro based simulation models that incorporate a spatial or geographic dimension. We feel this is important as in many areas of microsimulation modelling, there are parallel literatures that have developed that apply simulation techniques to micro units that are not labelled microsimulation or in the case of the papers reviewed in this paper not labelled spatial microsimulation. The paper reviews a number of different application areas of spatially focused microsimulation models, including demography, welfare, health, regional development, transport planning, agrienvironmental analysis, crisis planning, land use and planning. We also review a number of the methodological choices made by modellers including scope, and spatial disaggregation, data sources, data creation methodology, validation and calibration and simulating change.},

	abstract = {A wide range of user groups from policy makers to media commentators demand ever more spatially detailed information yet the desired data are often not available at ﬁne spatial scales. Increasingly, small area estimation (SAE) techniques are called upon to ﬁll in these informational gaps by downscaling survey outcome variables of interest based on the relationships seen with key covariate data. In the process SAE techniques both rely extensively on small area Census data to enable their estimation and offer potential future substitute data sources in the event of Census data becoming unavailable. Whilst statistical approaches to SAE routinely incorporate intervals of uncertainty around central point estimates in order to indicate their likely accuracy, the continued absence of such intervals from spatial microsimulation SAE approaches severely limits their utility and arguably represents their key methodological weakness. The present article presents an innovative approach to resolving this key methodological gap based on the estimation of variance of the between-area error term from a multilevel regression speciﬁcation of the constraint selection for iterative proportional ﬁtting (IPF). The performance of the estimated credible intervals are validated against known Census data at the target small area and show an extremely high level of performance. As well as offering an innovative solution to this long-standing methodological problem, it is hoped more broadly that the research will stimulate the spatial microsimulation community to adopt and build on these foundations so that we can collectively move to a position where intervals of uncertainty are delivered routinely around spatial microsimulation small area point estimates.},

These models have proved useful in evaluating the impact of policy changes at the micro-level. Spatial microsimulation models contain geographical information and allow for a regional or local approach to policy analysis. This paper builds on previous work on urban systems by employing similar modelling techniques for the analysis of rural areas. It describes the development of the SMILE (Simulation Model for the Irish Local Economy) model. SMILE is a dynamic spatial microsimulation model designed to analyse the impact of policy change and economic development on rural areas in Ireland. At its core, SMILE is a model of population. It simulates the basic components of population change, fertility, mortality and internal migration, at a small area level. This paper describes the method for projecting population change at the subcounty level. Results from the 1991 and 1996 dynamic model at county level are discussed, and a brief comparison is made with other methods. Finally, the features that distinguish microsimulation models from other population projection models are discussed. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	title = {Exploring {Microsimulation} {Methodologies} for the {Estimation} of {Household} {Attributes}},
	abstract = {Microsimulation is a rapidly expanding area of spatial modelling, which seems to offer great potential for applied policy analysis. However, currently there is considerable debate on the most appropriate methodology for estimating micro-data. Household or individual attribute data can be represented both as lists and/or as tabulations. It has long been argued (Birkin and Clarke, 1995; Clarke, 1996; Williamson et al, 1998) that the representation of information on households and individuals in the form of lists offers greater efficiency of storage and spatial flexibility as well as an ability to update and forecast. This paper reviews the possibilities and methodologies of building list-based population micro-data for small areas. First, it evaluates the methods, which have been developed and employed so far for the estimation of population micro-data, outlining the advantages and drawbacks of each one of them. Then the paper investigates the comparison of methods for generating conditional probabilities by statistical matching techniques or by using probabilities directly from household data sets such as the Samples of Anonymised Records (SARs) and the Small Area Statistics (SAS) from the UK Census of population. In addition, it explores the combination of these methods in a microsimulation framework and presents micro-data outputs from a local labour market microsimulation model for Leeds. Finally, it highlights the difficulties of calibrating this kind of model and of validating the model outputs, given the absence of suitable observed statistics.},

It has long been argued that spatial microsimulation modelling has enormous potential for the evaluation of the socio-economic and spatial effects of major developments in the regional or local economy. This paper aims to add to this rapidly expanding work, by presenting a new spatial microsimulation model (SIMALBA) for Scotland (the development of which was co-funded by the Scottish Government) and by demonstrating how it can be used to perform what-if policy analysis in Scotland. The focus of the paper is on economic aspects of social and spatial inequality in the capital of Scotland, Edinburgh. The paper shows how spatial microsimulation modelling can address previously unanswered research questions in Scotland, particularly those relating to ﬁscal policy. The SIMALBA model has estimated income data for Scotland at output area level geography and this is the focus of the various ‘what-if’ policy scenarios. Simulated data has been created using a deterministic reweighing algorithm to build a spatial microsimulation model by combining UK Census data for 2001 and Scottish Health Survey (SHS) data for 2003. The analysis demonstrates the importance of geography by examining trends at OA level in Scotland. The paper concludes with a discussion of the simulated data and resulting policy scenarios as well as the impact of this analysis for policy formation in Scotland.},

	abstract = {Iterative proportional ﬁtting (IPF) is a widely used method for spatial microsimulation. The technique results in non-integer weights for individual rows of data. This is problematic for certain applications and has led many researchers to favour combinatorial optimisation approaches such as simulated annealing. An alternative to this is ‘integerisation’ of IPF weights: the translation of the continuous weight variable into a discrete number of unique or ‘cloned’ individuals. We describe four existing methods of integerisation and present a new one. Our method – ‘truncate, replicate, sample’ (TRS) – recognises that IPF weights consist of both ‘replication weights’ and ‘conventional weights’, the effects of which need to be separated. The procedure consists of three steps: (1) separate replication and conventional weights by truncation; (2) replication of individuals with positive integer weights; and (3) probabilistic sampling. The results, which are reproducible using supplementary code and data published alongside this paper, show that TRS is fast, and more accurate than alternative approaches to integerisation.},

	abstract = {The daily trip to work is ubiquitous, yet its characteristics differ widely from person to person and place to place. This is manifested in statistics on mode and distance of travel, which vary depending on a range of factors that operate at different scales. This heterogeneity is problematic for decision makers tasked with encouraging more sustainable commuter patterns. Numerical models, based on real commuting data, have great potential to aid the decision making process. However, we contend that new approaches are needed to advance knowledge about the social and geographical factors that relate to the diversity of commuter patterns, if policies targeted to speciﬁc individuals or places are to be effective. To this end, the paper presents a spatial microsimulation approach, which combines individual-level survey data with geographically aggregated census results to tackle the problem. This method overcomes the limitations imposed by the lack of available geocoded micro-data. Further, it allows a range of scales of analysis to be pursued in parallel and provides insights into both the types of area and individual that would beneﬁt most from speciﬁc interventions.},

The models combine sample records with benchmark data for pre-defined geographic areas typically by sampling or re-weighting sample records to fit a set of constraints for each area. The choice of constraints is a key factor in producing microdata that reflect the population structure. This paper introduces the use of within-area homogeneity for selecting categorical constraint variables for spatial microsimulation. The d-statistic is a measure of within-area homogeneity, that is equivalent to intra-area correlation for areas with equal population. It can be used to identify the spatial autocorrelation exhibited by the categories of constraint variables, or combinations of categories, an important feature to reproduce when modelling local variation in a variable. It may be used to assess the statistical significance of the within-area homogeneity for a given set of categories and can assist in validating spatial microsimulation models.

This is an important policy consideration given Australia's rapidly ageing population. By using microdata and microsimulation models, this paper examines the national and spatial impacts on the distribution of poverty among older single people of an increase in the single age-pension rate. This paper shows that the cost of increasing the single age-pension to 66 per cent of the couple-age pension rate would be about \$A1.3 billion and would benefit about 824,000 single age-pensioners. Further, it is estimated that such an increase would reduce poverty rates for lone older persons from 46.5 per cent to 36.5 per cent, a 10-percentage point reduction. Looking at the spatial distribution of such benefits, the effect of the policy change seems to be generally stronger in capital cities, and in bands of rural areas in New South Wales and Victoria.

	abstract = {Obesogenic environments are a major explanation for the rapidly increasing prevalence in obesity. Investigating the relationship between obesity and obesogenic variables at the micro-level will increase our understanding about local differences in risk factors for obesity. SimObesity is a spatial microsimulation model designed to create micro-level estimates of obesogenic environment variables in the city of Leeds in the UK: consisting of a plethora of health, environment, and socio-economic variables. It combines individual micro-data from two national surveys with a coarse geography, with geographically finer scaled data from the 2001 UK Census, using a reweighting deterministic algorithm. This creates a synthetic population of individuals/households in Leeds with attributes from both the survey and census datasets. Logistic regression analyses identify suitable constraint variables to use. The model is validated using linear regression and equal variance t-tests. Height, weight, age, gender, and residential postcode data were collected on children aged 3-13 years in the Leeds metropolitan area, and obesity described as above the 98th centile for the British reference dataset. Geographically weighted regression is used to investigate the relationship between different obesogenic environments and childhood obesity. Validation shows that the small-area estimates were robust. The different obesogenic environments, as well as the parameter estimates from the corresponding local regression analyses, are mapped, all of which demonstrate non-stationary relationships. These results show that social capital and poverty are strongly associated with childhood obesity. This paper demonstrates a methodology to estimate health variables at the small-area level. The key to this technique is the choice of the model's input variables, which must be predictors for the output variables; this factor has not been stressed in other spatial microsimulation work. It also provides further evidence for the existence of obesogenic environments for children.},

Previous research highlights the relevance of simulation techniques in estimating the potential outcomes of changes in areas such as taxation and child benefit policy, crime, education, or health inequalities. To date, however, there is very little published research on the creation, calibration, and testing of such micropopulations and models, and little on the issue of how well synthetic data can fit locally as opposed to globally in such models. This paper discusses the process of improving the process of synthetic micropopulation generation with the aim of improving and extending existing spatial microsimulation models. Experiments using different variable configurations to constrain the models are undertaken with the emphasis on producing a suite of models to match the different sociodemographic conditions found within a typical city. The results show that creating processes to generate area-specific synthetic populations, which reflect the diverse populations within the study area, provides more accurate population estimates for future policy work than the traditional global model configurations.},

	abstract = {There are a wide range of methodological frameworks and techniques for policy evaluation and socio-economic impact assessment. A useful distinction is to divide the literature on such models by the level of resolution adopted. It is then possible to identify macro, meso and micro approaches. Macro models, dealing with whole countries or nations, are most common in economics and social policy. Meso-scale models, where countries or nations are split into regional zones, have a longer tradition in regional science, planning and geography (McCann 2001; Stimson et al. 2006). For example, many former macro-scale models such as input–output techniques are now increasingly appearing in the literature at the regional scale. Quantitative geographers have tended to build meso-scale models for smaller geographical regions, such as small-area census-based zoning systems within cities (Wilson 1974; Foot 1981; Stillwell and Clarke 2004; Fotheringham and Rogerson 2009). These types of model have a long history of applied success but the complex dynamics which underlie social and economic change, as emphasised in Chap. 2, can produce very different results within different small-area localities and even within individual households (or firms). In particular, it is useful to be able to understand, estimate or predict which localities, households or individuals (given their demographic and socio-economic characteristics) are most likely to benefit from a change in socio-economic or environmental policies. Thus, it could be argued that policy relevant modelling is a challenging research area which is well suited to a modelling framework which emphasises household or individual-level processes at the local or micro level rather than aggregated processes at the macro/meso-level.},

	abstract = {Abstract   Motorised transport infrastructure and increasingly specialised labour markets have resulted in energy intensive commuter patterns in many parts of the world. This is cause for concern due to the possibility of oil price shocks and the need to restrict the combustion of fossil fuels to minimise the chances of runaway climate change. The paper investigates methods to identify the spatial distribution and socio-demographic profiles of those who are vulnerable to high oil prices. It does this by use of four metrics of oil vulnerability which were developed using a spatial microsimulation model and applied to the case study region of Yorkshire and the Humber, UK. The metrics capture different aspects of vulnerability and highlight the importance of translating conceptual definitions into practical metrics. The geographically aggregated results coincide with the literature: rural areas are associated with the highest levels of vulnerability. The individual level results indicate that vulnerability can be prevalent even in seemingly resilient areas. Ultimately, we conclude that the social and spatial distribution of oil vulnerability depends on how an energy-constrained future is envisioned. Creating localised metrics about the future is a challenging task fraught with danger but could, provided that these metrics are interpreted with sufficient humility, aid the development of equitable policies to encourage resilience, as part of a worldwide transition away from fossil fuels.},

The method gives poverty rates for small areas that are similar to those available from the 2006 Australian census, when the same definition of poverty was used. Various methods of validating the poverty rates have been used, including aggregating the poverty rates to a larger area and comparing them with official Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates from a survey, and applying the spatial microsimulation to larger areas and comparing with official Australian Bureau of Statistics survey results. Both these tests show that the estimates are comparable and fairly robust for most states in Australia.},

In addition to the size of the population and its age distribution, sex and location are also of importance for understanding needs and developing future infrastructure plans and growth policies. The projection of labour force growth is particularly important as labour is one of the primary inputs of economic production. This study aims to project the distribution of the future Australian population and its detailed characteristics. We analyse the projection of labour force growth in Australia and the proportion of people born outside the country, both at the district level, as examples of the model’s capability and applications. The microsimulation model used is designed to capture a detailed picture of the demographic evolution of the Australian population given current population trends, while also enabling us to understand the spatial distribution of migrants among the future Australian population. We validate our projections by making comparisons with recently released census data from 2016. The validation procedures we use show that our model has managed to not only project the population for sub-state/territory regions but also its age distribution as well as whether a person was born outside Australia. However, although our projection of the total size of the labour force produces reasonably accurate results, we found that estimates of the growth of the labour force were not as reliable, as the model was unable to capture the current negative growth of the labour force that is reflected in recent census data.},

Some city-specific studies have developed new primary data collection efforts to analyze inequality at the neighborhood level, but methods from spatial microsimulation have yet to be broadly used in sociology to take better advantage of existing public data sets. The American Community Survey (ACS) is the largest household survey in the United States and indispensable for detailed analysis of specific places and populations. The authors propose a technique, tree-based spatial microsimulation, to produce “small-area” (census-tract) estimates of any person- or household-level phenomenon that can be derived from ACS microdata variables. The approach is straightforward and computationally efficient, based only on publicly available data, and it provides more reliable estimates than do prevailing methods of microsimulation. The authors demonstrate the technique’s capabilities by producing tract-level estimates, stratified by race/ethnicity, of (1) the proportion of people in the census-tract population who have children and work in an essential occupation and (2) the proportion of people in the census-tract population living below the federal poverty threshold and in a household that spends greater than 50 percent of monthly income on rent or owner costs. These examples are relevant to understanding the sociospatial inequalities dramatized by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The authors discuss potential extensions of the technique to derive small-area estimates of variables observed in surveys other than the ACS.},

The availability of small area data has improved dramatically since the late 1990s yet many spatial variables of interest – income, fear of crime, health-related behaviours, and so the list goes on – remain impossible to access at small area geographies (i.e. beneath local authority level in the UK context). Various alternative methodologies have emerged to carry out SAE and these can be grouped broadly into statistical approaches and spatial microsimulation approaches, each with multiple differing approaches within them. A recent network, funded by the ESRC National Centre for Research Methods, brought together experts from across these methodological approaches and relevant external partners in order to enhance the state of the art in SAE through stimulating detailed comparative methodological discussion so as to better understand the strengths, weaknesses, similarities and differences between these methodologies. This methodological review paper emerges from the network discussions and aims to: summarise the main methodological approaches to SAE and their linkages; discuss the role of the small area covariate data and the opportunities and challenges around such data; identify the main methodological priorities around SAE in need of collective research attention; and, propose the need for a collective multi-methods SAE project in order more fully explore the conceptual and technical linkages between the statistical and spatial microsimulation methodologies},

Second, we review existing literature on regional and local modelling techniques and the use of spatial models as tools for policy analysis. Third, we describe the SMILE static model. The model generates synthetic spatially referenced population for the Irish Republic at the small area level—the population micro data is produced for district electoral divisions (DEDs). Finally, we show how data from other sources can be linked to the static model output. We link data from the Irish National Farm Survey on farm system, income and off-farm employment of operator to the SMILE static model.

	doi = {10.1002/psp.601},
	abstract = {This paper uses spatial microsimulation to calculate small area poverty severity and headcount poverty in Australia using the Foster-Greer-Thorbeck method. The estimates of poverty severity across Australia, and for certain subgroups of the population, are then compared with headcount poverty rates. Areas of difference are highlighted, and the reasons for some of these differences are investigated further. Because the spatial microsimulation gives unit record data on incomes in each small area, we can compare the microsimulated income distributions for the small areas to see what drives the difference between headcount poverty and poverty severity.

We find that the headcount poverty rate is in the same quintile as poverty severity for 63\% of people in Australia. The headcount poverty rate tends to be lower than poverty severity in areas where there is extreme poverty, and this is confirmed by looking at the microsimulated income distribution of areas where the differences were greater. This may be because poverty severity is giving greater weight to the extreme poor compared with headcount poverty. There were very few areas where the headcount poverty was higher than poverty severity.

Looking at older single people, the picture was very different. Only 36\% of aged single people were in the same quintile. In many areas, the headcount poverty was much higher than poverty severity. Areas where the headcount poverty rate was higher than the poverty severity tended to be areas where there were a number of people very close to the poverty line, which is common for aged single people on a pension.

	abstract = {Census data can be represented both as lists and as tabulations of household/individual attributes. List representation of Census data offers greater flexibility, as the exploration of interrelationships between population characteristics is limited only by the quality and scope of the data collected. Unfortunately, the released lists of household/individual attributes (Samples of Anonymised Records, SARs) are spatially referenced only to areas (single or merged districts) with populations of 120 000 or more, whereas released tabulations are available for units as small as single enumeration districts (Small Area Statistics, SAS). Intuitively, it should be possible to derive list-based estimates of enumeration district populations by combining information contained in the SAR and the SAS. In this paper we explore the range of solutions that could be adapted to this problem which, ultimately, is presented as a complex combinatorial optimisation problem. Various techniques of combinatorial optimisation are tested, and preliminary results from the best performing algorithm are evaluated. Through this process, the lack of suitable test statistics for the comparison of observed and expected tabulations of population data is highlighted.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to provide a new framework for the analysis and the evaluation of national social policies at the small-area level. In particular, the paper shows how microsimulation modelling can be employed to shed new light on the local impacts of major national policy changes such as taxes, regulations, government consumption, unemployment benefits, job seekers', and housing allowances, etc. Microsimulation modelling provides the possibility of defining the desired effects of economic and social policy, the instruments employed, and also the structural changes of those affected by socioeconomic policy measures. This paper builds on traditional economic microsimulation frameworks by adding a geographical dimension. More specifically, we seek to model national social policy impacts at a microspatial scale. First, spatial microsimulation modelling is used to synthesise a household micropopulation geographical database for an entire city. This micropopulation database has a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic attributes that are relevant to national social and economic policies and which play a major role in the determination of eligibility of households for various benefits and allowances. GIS software is used to identify the size and spatial location of particular groups such as the unskilled, low-waged, and undereducated. Finally, we explore potential social policies and demonstrate how microsimulation modelling can be used to perform what-if social policy analysis at the small-area level.},

However, the technique also poses numerous methodological challenges, including the utilisation of two different databases simultaneously to produce estimates of population characteristics at the local level. An important but neglected question is whether different distributions of key variables within these two databases may affect the validity of the spatial estimation results. This study uses the significant policy issue of small-area estimates of child poverty rates in Australia to examine this question. The different income distributions for families with children in the two databases and the consequent effect on child-poverty estimates are assessed, while the apparent validity of these synthetic small-area poverty rates is gauged.},

Then, census data on those same indicators are used to estimate poverty rates for each of the 543 rural districts.

Using survey data for Bangladesh we find significant and sizable geographic effects on living standards after controlling for a wide range of nongeographic characteristics of households, as would typically be observable to policy makers. The geographic structure of living standards is reasonably stable over time, consistent with observed migration patterns, and robust to testable sources of bias.},

	abstract = {Hundreds of millions of poor families receive some form of targeted social assistance. Many of these antipoverty programs involve some degree of geographic targeting, where aid is prioritized to the poorest regions of the country. However, policy makers in many low-resource settings lack the disaggregated poverty data required to make effective geographic targeting decisions. Using several independent datasets from Nigeria, this paper shows that high-resolution poverty maps, constructed by applying machine learning algorithms to satellite imagery and other nontraditional geospatial data, can improve the targeting of government cash transfers to poor families. Specifically, we find that geographic targeting relying on machine learning–based poverty maps can reduce errors of exclusion and inclusion relative to geographic targeting based on recent nationally representative survey data. This result holds for antipoverty programs that target both the poor and the extreme poor and for initiatives of varying sizes. We also find no evidence that machine learning–based maps increase targeting disparities by demographic groups, such as gender or religion. Based in part on these findings, the Government of Nigeria used this approach to geographically target emergency cash transfers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.},

We find large gains from targeting smaller administrative units, such as districts or villages. However, these gains are still far from the poverty reduction that would be possible had the planners had access to information on household level income or consumption.

	abstract = {Typical living standards surveys can provide a wealth of information about welfare levels, poverty, and other household and individual characteristics. However, these estimates are necessarily at a high level of aggregation, because such surveys usually include only a few thousand households, with coarse spatial stratification. Larger databases, such as national censuses, provide sufficient observations for more disaggregated analysis, but typically collect very little socioeconomic information. This paper combines data from the 1996–97 Mozambique National Household Survey of Living Conditions with the 1997 National Population and Housing Census to generate small-area (subdistrict) estimates of welfare, poverty, and inequality, with the associated standard errors. These small-area estimates are then used to explore several dimensions of poverty and inequality in Mozambique, particularly with regard to geographical targeting of antipoverty efforts. Reliably identifying and targeting the poor can be administratively costly, especially in rural Africa, where low population density and weak administrative capacity are common. Geographical targeting, or targeting poor areas, is sometimes proposed as a feasible alternative to targeting poor people, and poverty maps may serve as a valuable tool in this regard. Unfortunately, the notion of poor areas might not always be especially useful, as appears to be the case in Mozambique. The poverty maps do not reveal a particularly strong spatial concentration of poverty; the differences in poverty levels between areas tend to be subtle. This pattern is also observed in the decomposition of small-area inequality estimates, which shows that only about 20 percent of consumption inequality is accounted for by inequality between districts or between administrative posts. The picture that emerges of the poor living alongside the nonpoor indicates that targeting poor areas is likely to result in leakage to the nonpoor in that area, and considerable under-coverage of the significant numbers of poor households in areas that are less poor.},

We focus on changes in employment and aggregate hours worked between February 2020 and April 2020 while accounting for normal monthly changes in these indicators. We find that COVID-19 induced a 32 percent decline in aggregate weekly work hours among workers aged 20–64 years, alongside a 15 percent decline in employment. We characterize the distribution of work lost, finding that nearly half of job losses are attributed to workers in the bottom earnings quartile. Those most affected by COVID-19 are in public-facing jobs in industries most affected by shutdowns (accommodation and food services), younger workers, paid hourly, and non-union. The results provide context for policy development, with both supply and demand sides of the labour market to consider.},

            This study contributes to the debate on whether income inequality is harmful for health by addressing several analytical weaknesses of previous studies. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics in combination with tract-level measures of income inequality in the United States, we estimate the effects of differential exposure to income inequality during three decades of the life course on mortality. Our study is among the first to consider the implications of income inequality within U.S. tracts for mortality using longitudinal and individual-level data. In addition, we improve upon prior work by accounting for the dynamic relationship between local areas and individuals' health, using marginal structural models to account for changes in exposure to local income inequality. In contrast to other studies that found no significant relation between income inequality and mortality, we find that recent exposure to higher local inequality predicts higher relative risk of mortality among individuals at ages 45 or older.},

	abstract = {Résumé Les méthodes pour analyser les quartiers urbains au Canada se sont principalement développées à partir d'études sur les grandes villes telles que Montréal, Toronto et Vancouver. Les analyses statistiques des quartiers en mutation adoptent généralement le secteur de recensement (SR) comme l'unité d'analyse géographique de base. Toutefois, l'utilisation de l'échelle du SR dans des villes de plus petite taille peut donner lieu à des conclusions erronées, parce que cette unité couvre une trop grande superficie, masquant ainsi l'hétérogénéité démographique à l'intérieur du SR. Ce phénomène connu en tant que problème de l'aire modifiable des unités analysées (modifiable areal unit problem ou MAUP) a attiré l'attention des géographes. En interrogeant les données du recensement canadien de 2006 sur les conditions matérielles, sociales et structurelles des quartiers d'Halifax, en Nouvelle-Écosse, nous explorons le degré du MAUP dans cette ville de la région atlantique et nous testons l'utilité de l'aire de diffusion (AD) comme unité d'analyse alternative dans les villes à petite échelle. Nous offrons un aperçu des effets du MAUP sur l'analyse ainsi que des suggestions quant à la façon dont les urbanistes peuvent tenir compte des impacts du MAUP dans leur travail. Abstract Methods for analyzing Canadian neighbourhoods have developed principally from studies of large cities such as Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver. Statistical analyses on neighbourhood change in Canada, moreover, have adopted Census Tracts (CTs) as their main geographic units of analysis. However, using CTs as a proxy for neighbourhoods in smaller cities may generate misleading conclusions because such units cover too large an area and potentially mask heterogeneity of populations living within them. This phenomenon is known as the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) and has been investigated by geographers. Data on material, social, and structural conditions of neighbourhoods in Halifax, Nova Scotia from the 2006 Canadian Census are explored to examine the degree of the MAUP in this smaller city and to assess the usefulness of Dissemination Areas as an alternative unit of analysis for small cities. We also offer insight on how the MAUP affects analysis and make suggestions as to how planners can adjust their analyses with this in mind.},

            Scale is a central concept in the geographical sciences and is an intrinsic property of many spatial systems. It also serves as an essential thread in the fabric of many other physical and social sciences, which has contributed to the use of different terminology for similar manifestations of what we refer to as ‘scale’, leading to a surprising amount of diversity around this fundamental concept and its various ‘multiscale’ extensions. To address this, we review common abstractions about spatial scale and how they are employed in quantitative research. We also explore areas where the conceptualizations of multiple spatial scales can be differentiated. This is achieved by first bridging terminology and concepts, and then conducting a scoping review of the topic. A typology for spatial scale is discussed that can be used to categorize its multifarious meanings and measures. This typology is then used to distinguish what we term ‘process scale,’ from other types of spatial scale and to highlight current trends in uncovering aspects of process scale. We end with suggestions on how to further build knowledge regarding spatial processes through the lens of spatial scale.},
